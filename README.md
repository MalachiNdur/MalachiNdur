## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing an M.S. in Business Analytics at William & Mary, building on my academic foundation in Psychology from Brown University. With five years of Division I basketball experience, I bring a unique blend of discipline, leadership, and strategic thinking to everything I do.

My passion lies at the intersection of sports and data. I'm especially interested in using analytics to drive smarter decisions in player development and team performanceâ€”translating numbers into insights that impact the game.

Whether I'm working on a data model, collaborating on a team project, or diving into new tools and techniques, I approach each challenge with curiosity and a drive to learn. Iâ€™m always looking for opportunities to grow, contribute, and create something meaningful.
